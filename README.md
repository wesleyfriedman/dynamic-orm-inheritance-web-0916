FINISHED WALK-THROUGH
# Dynamic ORM with Inheritance

## Objectives

1. Explain why it is useful to have a ORM class from which other classes in your program can inherit
2. Describe the code that is used to construct such a class

## Why Inheritance?

The great thing about a Dynamic ORM is that it provides us with a way to write an ORM that is almost entirely abstract. In other words, the methods we write that allow a given Ruby class and instances to communicate with a database are *not specific to any one class*.

This means we can use such methods again and again. We can define them in only one place and simply make them available, via inheritance, to any other class in our program.

## The Super Class

In this repo, in the `lib` directory, you'll see the `interactive_record.rb` file. Open it up and take a look.

You'll see that the `InteractiveRecord` class contains almost all of the code responsible for communicating between our Ruby program and our database. All of the methods defined there are abstract––they do not reference explicit class or attribute names nor do they reference explicit table or column names.

These are methods that can be used by *any Ruby class or instance*, as long as we make them available to that class or instance.

## The Child Class

Go ahead and open up `lib/song.rb`. Notice that the `Song` class *inherits* from `InteractiveRecord`. This means that *all* of the methods defined in `InteractiveRecord` are available to `Song`.

The only code the `Song` class needs to contain is the code to create the `attr_accessor`s specific to itself. But even that code uses a method, `#column_names`, inherited from the super class.

## Our Code in Action

Open up the executable file in `bin/run`.

```ruby
song = Song.new(name: "Hello", album: "25")
puts "song name: " + song.name
puts "song album: " + song.album
song.save

DB[:conn].execute("SELECT * FROM songs")
```

Here we create a new `Song` instance, `puts` out some information about it, save it to the database and then retrieve it from the database. The `#create`, `#save` and `#find_by_name` methods used here were inherited by `Song` from `InteractiveRecord`.

If you run this file, you should see the following in your terminal:

```bash
song name: Hello
song album: 25
{"id"=>1, "name"=>"Hello", "album"=>"25", 0=>1, 1=>"Hello", 2=>"25"}
```

## Looking Ahead

As we begin to build complex web applications using Sinatra and Rails, this pattern of inheritance will become familiar. In fact, we'll use an ORM tool called Active Record that handles *all* of the ORM interactions for us, and we'll simply inherit our Ruby classes from Active Record's classes.
